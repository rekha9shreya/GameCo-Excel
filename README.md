# GameCo-Excel
In this project, I used Excel to analyze GameCo data  (a gaming company) and created results and statistical graphs that could help GameCo have a better understanding of how their games would do in the market. 

# Objectives 
GameCo is a new video gaming company that wants to use data to inform the development of new games. The goal of this project is to conduct a descriptive analysis of a video game data set in order to have a better understanding of how GameCo's games would do in the market.

# Key Questions 
To fulfill the goals of this project, I needed to identify what questions I needed to answer with this data set. 
- Are certain types of games more popular than others?
- What other publishers will likely be the main competitors in certain markets?
- Have any games decreased or increased in popularity over time?
- How have their sales figures varied between geographic regions over time?

# Data 
To do this project I used a dataset that was provided to me by CareerFoundry, the data was drawn from the website [VGChartz](https://www.vgchartz.com/) This data set covers historical sales of video games (for games that sold more than 10,000 copies, spanning different platforms, genres, and publishing studios. 

# Tools
This data was analyzed through a spreadsheet editor; Microsoft Excel.
Graphs and slides were created through a presentation program; Google Slides and Google Docs.
